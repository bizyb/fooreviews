# Fooreviews

Reading product reviews on Amazon or Best Buy can be a time-consuming process. Fooreviews attempts to solve this problem by distilling customer reviews into topics. Users can learn about the various features of a product by looking at the summary generated and the corresponding sentiment and topic distribution charts. In addition, Fooreviews plots the metadata on all the reviews for a given product to get time-dependent trends on customer behavior.
