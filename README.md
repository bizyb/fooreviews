# Fooreviews

Fooreviews distills customer reviews into topics using natural language processing and some bit of machine learning. Users can learn about the various features of a product by looking at the summary generated and the corresponding sentiment and topic distribution charts. In addition, Fooreviews plots the metadata on all the reviews for a given product to get time-dependent trends on customer behavior.
